# Asset tracker 

A script that tracks assets for you based on Onvista data.  
You can specify a percentage threshold and you'll get an Email  
once the asset falls under that threshold relative to yesterday's close.  

The script was designed to work with Python 3.8
Currently it works only with derivatives.
